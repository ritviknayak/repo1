1. One time pad(OTP) is when the length of the cipher = length of the message. But it is very costly


2. From the table that has been provided, we can coclude that this is a vigenere cipher

3. we use the table along with the given encrypted flag and key to get the message

4. Each letter of the given key form the rows. In each of theose rows we search for the corresponding letter given as the encrypted flag.
	The corresponding letter given in that column will 	be the final answer. 


	
	ecrypted flag: UFJKXQZQUNB
	key:	       SOLVECRYPTO

	Final answer:  CRYPTOISFUN
